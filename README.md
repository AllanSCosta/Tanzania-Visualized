# Tanzania-Visualized
IDHack project - Visualization of Tanzanian data


This project is being developed for the IDHack hackathon and the World Bank.
We're analysing, decoding and creating visualizations from governmental databases offered by Tanzania's Open Data source - opendata.go.tz
The code is based on HTML, CSS and both D3.Js and D3PLUS.
Inspired by Social Computing group of Media Lab, MIT.
Feel free to download the code and improve the visualizations.
